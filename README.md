A microservices platform built in Java and Spring Boot, organized with various services representing common functionalities in e-commerce applications (such as login service, shopping cart, products, orders, etc.).

## Overview

This repository contains microservices that implement separate functionalities independently, using:

- Java with Spring Boot
- Microservices organized by domain
- PostgreSQL as a database
- Kafka for communication between services
- Architecture designed for scalability and maintenance.
